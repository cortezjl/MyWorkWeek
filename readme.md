###Problem Statement 

I am part owner of a restaurant where we have a point of service (POS) system.  The POS system includes a Scheduler to 
be able to create a weekly work schedule for employees that are in the POS system.  It is not easy to use and doesn’t 
allow you to schedule employees for a time period that is not an actual time (for example, 2 PM to Close).  There are 
also some laws related to young employees that need to be accounted for scheduling during the school year.  For example,
 if they are under 16 then they can’t work past 7 PM and cannot work more than 17 hours
 per week.
   
Currently, employees will submit a paper monthly calendar of days/times they need off for the upcoming month..  They can 
also request off for dates beyond the upcoming month.  For example, dates they need off for a vacation several months 
from now.  Those dates are typically written on a different calendar.  

Producing the weekly work schedule is being done manually and the manager writing up the schedule has to look through 
all the paper time off requests and the wall calendar when creating a schedule.  A blank template is printed off with the days of the week and the names of the current 
employees on it and split into 4 areas:
1.	Shift Manager
2.	Front of House (FOH), which is for people working the registers, drive-thru and to keep the dining area clean
3.	Back of House (BOH), which is the various kitchen staff
4.  Bussers

I want to create a scheduling system that will allow users to submit time off requests and that managers can create a weekly work schedule that includes any current employees.  The time off request information needs to be available when creating the schedule for the work week to try an accommodate any days/times that the employees need off.
