### Thursday, Sept 12th 3 hours
Work on Week 2 Exercise determineInverseCaptcha logic.  Added Logger statements to verify input file being processed correctly.  Used a 
smaller part of the input file initially to verify the logic was working correctly.  Edited a copy of 
the input file to find the expected value for the Junit test.  Ran Junit tests and test passed.

### Saturday, Sept 14th 9 hours
Work on Week 2 Exercise to add additional Junit tests.  Rewrote determineInverseCaptcha logic after rereading how the 
files should be processed.  Had trouble figuring out how to test the FileNotFoundException, but once I added to throw 
the exception and not catch them, then it returned the exception to the test correctly.
Started week 3 custom tag library demo and activity.

### Sunday, Sept 15th 8 hours
Didn't have week 3 activity for custom tag library working.  Completed this weeks readings, which helped.  Was able to 
get the activity completed and the weekly exercise.  Created private repositories for both and added Paula as a 
collaborator, so she has access to review them.  Added ProjectPlan for the individual project, using Paula's example as
a model.

### Wednesday, Sept 18th
Class night.  Made additional updates to the readme file.  Looked for an API to use again.  Initially will use
