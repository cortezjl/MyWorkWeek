### Thursday, Sept 12th 3 hours
Work on Week 2 Exercise determineInverseCaptcha logic.  Added Logger statements to verify input file being processed correctly.  Used a 
smaller part of the input file initially to verify the logic was working correctly.  Edited a copy of 
the input file to find the expected value for the Junit test.  Ran Junit tests and test passed.

### Saturday, Sept 14th 7 hours
Work on Week 2 Exercise to add additional Junit tests.  Rewrote determineInverseCaptcha logic after rereading how the 
files should be processed.  Had trouble figuring out how to test the FileNotFoundException, but once I added to throw 
the exception and not catch them, then it returned the exception to the test correctly.
